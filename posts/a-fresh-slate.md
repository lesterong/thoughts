Today, we begin on a fresh slate.

This is the second edition of my blog, and I've finally given it a fresh coat of paint, and maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to start penning down my thoughts more consistently. Kinda already failed since I took a month to even get this post up, but here's to a fresh start!

I spent a good chunk of my summer break working part time to earn some spare cash, and now with one month left, I feel like I haven't accomplished much at all :(. On the bright side, I've started to be more consistent with my gym and bulking journey, and I'm starting to feel so much happier with myself physically. 

There's a lot more that I would like to achieve in this one month before school begins, and I'm just going to pen down some of those, in no order of priority:

1. Stay consistent on my bulking and gym journey, even throughout the semester (and get my IPPT for this year out of the way)
2. Pen down my thoughts more consistently
3. Continue with the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en) course, which I've been at part 3 since a month ago
4. Get down to replacing all the stuff broke throughout the sem - my phone (no thanks, S20 for the 7 *and counting* vertical green lines), my IEMs and my shoes
5. Rest up before the new semester begins, and maybe pick up a book or two

And well, I'm off to try to achieve my goals -- till next time!
